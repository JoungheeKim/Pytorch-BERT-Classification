# Pytorch-BERT-Classification
This is pytorch simple implementation of [Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
Language Understanding (BERT)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) by using awesome [pytorch BERT library](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers)

### Dataset
To test model, I use a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews taken from IMDb. 
It is divied into 'train', 'test' dataset and each data has 25,000 movie reviews and labels(positive, negetive).
You can access to dataset with this [link](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
